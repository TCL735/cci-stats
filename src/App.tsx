                  Ten Ton Is Number 1 (or Ten Ton as his friends call him) is
                  co-host of the popular gambling podcast Casino Tears which
                  focuses primarily on craps players and serious connoisseurs of
                  the game.

                  Discipline and accountability are issues that every craps
                  player let alone every gambler struggles with. Accountability,
                  to a much lesser extent, is often times conveniently
                  overlooked because it can be a real tough pill to swallow. In
                  addition, and in many cases, it might not be too convenient or
                  fit too nicely into a player‚Äôs self described narrative as a
                  ‚Äúwinner‚Äù or ‚Äúthe best‚Äù (read social media/content /strategy

                  That said, if we‚Äôre gonna live in Vegas and talk about craps
                  and do the damn thing then we better be able to walk the walk.
                  Thus‚Ä¶ Color-Comin-In (or as we like to call it, CCI.Vegas) was
                  born. CCI is a simple interactive way to track win/loss
                  progress for the year. In a very Tron inspired way we can see
                  our bank roll travel up into the neon green zone or down into
                  the neon pink. The later is preferred of course üòä

                <p className="text-pretty">
                  CCI also tracks other interesting details of the sessions that
                  one may find relevant. For example: if I shoot or don‚Äôt shoot,
                  who I played with, how long I played, what prop bets were
                  played etc etc. These are all details that I personally find
                  value in looking back on during any post session
                  self-evaluation. CCI is very much a work in progress. Will we
                  be up over the course of the year? Will we be down? To be
                  continued...

                  I would like to thank my friend Vegas Day Tripper for
                  inspiring me with this idea and TCL for building and designing
                  the page. I hope the transparency of our play will not only
                  provide historical insight but more importantly raise topics
                  for deeper investigation that ideally lead to valuable lessons
                  along with a positive paydays.
