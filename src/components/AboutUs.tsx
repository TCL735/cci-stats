        Discipline and accountability are issues that every craps player, let
        alone every gambler, struggles with. Accountability, to a much lesser
        extent, is often times conveniently overlooked because it can be a real
        tough pill to swallow. In addition, and in many cases, it might not be
        too convenient or fit too nicely into a player‚Äôs self described
        narrative as a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù or ‚Äú being the best‚Äù.

        Color-Comin-In (or as we like to call it, CCI.Vegas) was born. CCI is a
        simple interactive way to track win/loss progress for the year. In a
        very Tron inspired way we can see our bank roll travel up into the neon
        green zone or down into the neon pink. The former is preferred of
        course. üòä

      <p className="text-pretty">
        CCI also tracks other interesting details of the sessions that one may
        find relevant. For example: did I shoot, from where, what set, who I
        played with, how long I played, what prop bets were played etc etc.
        These are all details that I personally find value in looking back on
        during any post session self-evaluation. CCI is very much a work in
        progress. Will we be up over the course of the year? Will we be down? To
        be continued...

        I would like to thank my friend Vegas Day Tripper for inspiring me with
        this idea and TCL for building and designing the page. I hope the
        transparency of our play will not only provide historical insight but
        more importantly raise topics for deeper investigation that ideally lead
        to valuable lessons along with a positive paydays.
