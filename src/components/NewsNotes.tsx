        Discipline and accountability are issues that every craps player, let
        alone every gambler, struggles with. Accountability, to a much lesser
        extent, is often times conveniently overlooked because it can be a real
        tough pill to swallow. In addition, and in many cases, it might not be
        too convenient or fit too nicely into a player‚Äôs self described
        narrative as a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù or ‚Äú being the best‚Äù.

        That said, since Ten Ton lives in Vegas and is actually ‚Äúdoing the damn
        thing‚Äù as a craps player then he better be able to walk the walk. Thus‚Ä¶
        Color-Comin-In (or as we like to call it, CCI.Vegas) was born. CCI is a
        simple interactive way to track win/loss progress for the year. In a
        very Tron inspired way we can see our bank roll travel up into the neon
        green zone or down into the neon pink. The former is preferred of
        course. üòä
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-pretty">
        CCI also tracks other interesting details of the sessions that one may
        find relevant. For example: did I shoot, from where, what set, who I
        played with, how long I played, what prop bets were played etc etc.
        These are all details that I personally find value in looking back on
        during any post session self-evaluation. CCI is very much a work in
        progress. Will we be up over the course of the year? Will we be down? To
        be continued...

        I would like to thank my friend Vegas Day Tripper for inspiring me with
        this idea and TCL for building and designing the page. I hope the
        transparency of our play will not only provide historical insight but
        more importantly raise topics for deeper investigation that ideally lead
        to valuable lessons along with a positive paydays.

        Re 2024 - it was a good test run and I learned a lot - most importantly
        tracking is very difficult especially when you‚Äôre playing multiple
        sessions while doing a ton of other things like having a full time job,
        a weekly podcast, a life ‚Ä¶.etc etc etc. Right before our 3 day class
        experience in Nov was when I fell off with the tracking. Horrible timing
        as I went on to have one helluva end to the 2024 craps hunting season.{" "}

        Lots and lots of helpful insights were gleaned from the 2024 data
        analysis though. This tracking helped me take an objective look at a few
        factors of my play which ultimately led to some major improvements. I‚Äôm
        hoping to be one of the only social media gambling influencers to
        provide this kind of honest/real data because if you‚Äôre out there
        believing all these slots, sports betting, black jack etc etc
        influencers are winning players‚Ä¶..well‚Ä¶.I have a bridge to sell you and
